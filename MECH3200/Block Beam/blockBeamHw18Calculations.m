% HW18 SECTION START ------------------------------------------
% Generate a psudeo phase plot for this system. On the x axis plot z and on
% the y axis plot theta. Then use the quiver command to plot z_ddot and
% theta_ddot as arrows. Assume the velocities are zero at all points. The
% input should also be zero at all points. However, you should experiment
% with different input forces to see how the equlibrium point changes. You
% axis limits should range from 0 to 5 decimeters (1 decimeter = 0.1 m) for
% z and -5 to 5 degrees for theta.
