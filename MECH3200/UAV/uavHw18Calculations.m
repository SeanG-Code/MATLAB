% HW18 SECTION START ------------------------------------------
% Generate a phase plot for the longitudinal system and  psudeo phase plot
% for the lateral system. For the longitudinal system plot h on the x axis
% and h_dot on the y axis. Then use the quiver command to plot h_dot and
% h_ddot as arrows. For the lateral system plot z on the x axis and theta
% on the y axis. Then use the quiver command to plot z_ddot and theta_ddot
% as arrows. For the lateral system assume the velocities are zero at all
% points. The input should also be F_e/2 for both motors. However, you
% should experiment with different input forces to see how the equlibrium
% point changes. Your axis limits should range from -4 to 4 m for h, -4 to
% 4 m/s for h_dot, -45 to 45 m for z, and -45 to 45 degrees for theta.
% Keep in mind that you will need to find the lateral and longitudinal
% phase plots seperately (i.e. you must call the dynamics command
% seperately for the lateral system and the longitudinal system).
