% HW18 SECTION START ------------------------------------------
% Generate a phase plot for this system. On the x axis plot z and on
% the y axis plot z_dot. Then use the quiver command to plot z_dot
% and z_ddot as arrows. Assume the velocities are zero at all points.
% The input should also be zero at all points. However, you should
% experiment with different input forces to see how the equlibrium point
% and behavior changes. Try a constant equilibrium input at z=0 and
% also the feedback linearization input we've used previously. You axis
% limits should range from -1.5 to 1.5 degrees for z and -1.5 to 1.5
% degrees/s for z_dot.
